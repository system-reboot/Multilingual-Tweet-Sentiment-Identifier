# Sentiment analysis of Social Media Posts
The number of online trolls and bigots is rapidly increasing. This is because the user's anonymity has increased. They make comments and posts on social media accounts because they are confident that they will not be discovered. To prevent this and catch them, we designed a model that, when a user's username is entered, displays his or her prior history, i.e. the types of postings he has made.To prevent this and catch them, we established a model that reveals the person's prior history, such as what type of posts he has been posting, what type of posts he has been tagged in, and what he has commented on, and we can restrict that user from social media networks based on that information.
Our model's speciality is that it can also track identify comments made in HINDI or in any language.
